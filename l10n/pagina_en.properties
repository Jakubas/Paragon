paginae/exp/haven = There is light, and you find yourself surrounded by a vast and dark forest, with a path ahead of you stretching far off into some distant greenery. All around you, the land draws heavy breaths of wind, carrying with it scents of pine, and earth, and age.

paginae/exp/haveseat=It is nice to rest your weary bones from time to time. It is nice to lay down your burdens. It is nice to have a seat.
paginae/exp/headwaters=The river winds, on and on, and up and away. Whether you have followed the river here, or whether you stumbled upon it, you have nevertheless discovered its source here at these Headwaters. From this spring the river is continously made anew.

paginae/exp/icespire=Before you a gleaming spike of ice and silver rises toward the heavens, refractured with the cool of the snow and the mountain, sparkling like a million diamonds in the sun. You have found an Ice Spire.
paginae/exp/jotunmussel=Cast out before you as if by some Jotun hand lies an entish Mussel, glittering in the sun, and tattling tales of secret treasure.
paginae/exp/leapfree=Time pauses and leaves you suspended mid-air, a fly trapped in the amber of time, and for a lifetime passed in the wink of an eye, you hang there from nothing, in defiant conquest of time and space. The thunder of the world surging back into motion is deafening.
paginae/exp/mandrakeshriek = Chillingly your blood freezes as a howl as if from some midnight-haunting banshee pierces the dark. The root in your hand has come alive in the moonlight, and darts away from you before you have time to react.\n

paginae/exp/mountaindawn=Far away in the distant horizon, a great fiery orb rises in the sky, casting its warming light over the cold and age of the mountain. The view from here is breathtaking.
paginae/exp/newland=A feeling of mixed excitement and trepidation comes over you as you stand here, by this edge between two lands, waiting to cross.
paginae/exp/nidbane=An ill wind sweeps in with the vengeful shadow of a Nidbane approaching. The Nidbanes are vengeful spirits summoned to carry vengeance to those who have broken the Hearthlaw, on behalf of the wronged.
paginae/exp/pileup=You quietly think to yourself that all of cultured life is one long quest in pursuit of piling one thing ontop of another.
paginae/exp/quenching=You drink deep and greedily in full, dank, draughts, as visions of mist and Huldra dance within the theatre of your mind's eye.

paginae/exp/roaringfire=You are at the end of your efforts when, from crooked tinder set before you, there suddenly leaps, born of a single spark, a mighty Worm of flames blazing, wrapped in manes of soot and crimson.

paginae/exp/spelunking=You've entered a cave, and the light from the outside now grows fainter as you delve deeper into it. The cave appears to stretch on for some distance into the pitch.

paginae/exp/spindlepricked = It is like a fairy tale of unraveling thread, and more pain than you had honestly expected, as a red droplet bleeds out where you, just now, pricked yourself on the spindle. Ouch!\n
paginae/exp/strikeearth=You raise your shovel and strike, strike the earth. Dirt flies everywhere and a strong, numinous sense of good omens concerning the project comes over you. The gods smile at your ambitions.
paginae/exp/strikeroot=Well, that took some doing, but you finally managed to untangle those darn roots, and get that thing out of the ground. Now for what to make of it...
paginae/exp/talkingstone = An eerie feeling creeps over you as it slowly begins to dawn on you that the personage you have been searching for is none other than that old boulder now lying supinely before you, counting clouds, stars, and years. You can hear its whisper everywhere around you.\n
paginae/exp/talkingtree = For some reason some power higher than yourself has compelled you to seek out this tree, and it is to your great amazement that you hear -- directionless, as if in echo from everywhere and nowhere -- it speak to you in a soft, seductive voice. Perhaps it desires something?\n
paginae/exp/thesymbel = It is not every meal that feels like a grand banquet held in a well-lit Hall, in the company of Kings, to symphonies of blowing horns and roaring fires, flowing with mead, but this one does.

paginae/exp/treadgrass=A patch of grass brushes against your feet, touching them with dew and damp. It tickles, reminding you of childhood joys, as a smile radiates out across your lips, and further on and away toward a universe which you in this moment know could not know evil.

paginae/exp/wellwishing = The bucket rattles down to bluer fathoms below, and, as it does, the sublime beauty of the world around you suddenly occurs to you. Your heart takes the opportunity to make a secret wish.\n
paginae/exp/windthrow=Sometime, in the great old beginnings, when the Old Gods where still young, free, and wild, a mighty tree did here come crashing down. Now there is only shade, and damp, and the slow decay of ages. You have found an Ancient Windthrow.

paginae/skills/ahusb=$i{"Harnessed by the Old Gods,\nThe Urox plowed across the skies,\nThe furrow of time."}\n\nYou have had enough close encounters with various beasts of the Wild Hearth that the thought of taming some of them has entered your mind. You may snare and keep tamable beasts, as well as construct coops, troughs, and hitching posts.\n\nTo tame a wild, tamable, animal: \nFirst, lure it to you with clover.\nThen snare it with a rope.\nThen tie it to a hitching post.\nThen, when soon it stands ready to fight,\nDefeat it in combat again, and again,\nBut when it yields to you, yield to it,\nAnd hurt it no further,\nUntil its beast has been quelled.
paginae/skills/archery=$i{"Where Alfthing fell,\nOn blood-wet grass,\nA broken arrow."}\n\nWith basic mastery of Archery you can draw and fire bows, fletch arrows, and sew quivers.
paginae/skills/artifice=$i{"The Great Clockwork of the Hearth,\nTells the time of all times,\nTicks the sun, moves the beast, draws forth the plants to eat."}\n\nYou have seen far beyond the mundane trivialities of petty craftsmanship, and your thoughts seek in all matters of artifice the eternal. You enjoy the greatest possible success when mining and forging wrought iron.

Fishing poles catch fish immediatley whenever they bite, but the more demanding Rod fishing rather requries you to actually land the Fish by figuring out the many riddles of the sport. The truly rare fish of the world are caught with rods.
paginae/skills/forage=$i{"Full in her pride she stood,\nBlossoming through spring and autumn,\nWild with fruit and harvest-flowers."}\n\nYou know a thing or two about the wild plants of the land, and can see and pick a lot of them if you find them.

paginae/skills/hunting=$i{"In a bloodred moment,\nThe beast fell still,\nGiving life through death."}\n\nFor what it's worth you have built up enough skill and courage to dare to attack, slay, dress, and prepare wild animals. Beware that some fell beasts of the wilds will kill and eat you, and that you might not be a competent enough fighter yet to take them on. Start out small, with Ants, and build your skills, before going for bigger prey.\n\nSome small animals, like Rabbits and Frogs, can be picked up without a fight, if you can catch them.

Having the Lawspeaking skill allows your character to found villages.\n
paginae/skills/locks=$i{"This place was not for you,\nWas not meant for your eyes,\nWas locked away for me alone."}\n\nYou have learned how to craft and install locks to protect chests, coffers, and gates from intruders.

paginae/skills/oral = $i{"Of all the Ancients,\nMost among them saw Walwar,\nYet always spoke he the least."}\n\nThey say that the first stories were passed to the Hearthlings by the Old Gods. Some ancient things have always been known, and this is one of them.

paginae/skills/pottery=$i{"Cracked, the potter's clay,\nPouring water, scraping dry,\nThe Vessel of Eternity.}\n\nYou've learned the art of making pots, cups and vases from clay. You can dig for clay in the shallows, and fire your produce in a Kiln.
paginae/skills/rage=$i{"Insults fell on his mind,\nLike sparks on wet leaves,\nUntil the leaves, one day, were dry.}\n\nYou've had quite enough, and someone is going to get it hard and fast. Rage allows you to initiate combat with other Hearthlings.\n\nBeware that each breach of the Hearthlaw leaves a Crime Scent -- which can be used to track you down -- and that being an outlaw prevents your character from being logged out for some time after the offense.\n
paginae/skills/ropetwin=$i{"One over one,\nHe drew round over round,\nTwinning rope from golden strands"}\n\nYou can construct and use a Rope Walk to stretch, twine, and tie ropes.
paginae/skills/sausagemaking=$i{"Crank of lever,\nPull of pork,\nSplit the bone,\nWield the fork."}\n\nYour mind has begun salivating at the prospect of turning red meat and casings into some of the most succulent, delightful, morsels imaginable.

paginae/skills/silk=$i{"Ratjik's shirt was sewn,\nNot from fibre, nor hide,\nNot from animal, nor plant,\nWhat stuff made Ratjik's shirt?"}\n\nYou've been spending time among the mulberries, and have learned how to farm and handle silk. Breed Silkmoths, set their eggs on herbalist tables, feed the worms mulberry leaves, and unravel the cocoons.
paginae/skills/srv = $i{"Kodving broke the ice,\nSkarm drew him up,\nLogi saved them both."}\n\nThey say that the burning longings in the back of every Hearthling's mind are the ancient lores of Firemaking, and of Walking the Land & Wild. Any Hearthling who has passed through the Evergreen, and been burned into the world, knows how to build fire and shelter, provided she finds the right materials.
paginae/skills/steelmaking=$i{"Born in flame,\nYet cold and silent,\nThirsting for blood.\nWho am I?"}\n\nThe embers of your forge have run glowing red hot, and from them now spring the strangest, most wonderful materials.

paginae/skills/swim=$i{"Nine drops of rain-water,\nHe carried,\nOver land and black seas."}\n\nYou know how to get yourself out on deep water, which unfortunately carries with it the risk of never getting back alive to the shallows again.

paginae/skills/tools = $i{"Fashioned alone,\nBy fire at night,\nWith fire in mind,\nThree Ashen staves."}\n\nThey say that some mysterious forms are eternal lodestars written into the firmament of the Hearth. You think you could make a Stone Axe for yourself if you found the right materials.

You may construct stone columns to support your mining operations, and you find better ores when mining.
paginae/skills/vandal = $i{"The Skarm was forded by the late solstice,\nThe Heiskarl brought two by six ships.\nThe city was sacked.}\n\nSomething deep inside of you has begun yearning to see the world burn. You may destroy objects, and otherwise perform deleterious actions, on claims, without permission. \n\nBeware that each breach of the Hearthlaw leaves a Crime Scent -- which can be used to track you down -- and that being an outlaw prevents your character from being logged out for some time after the offense.\n

paginae/skills/winemaking=$i{"In autumn vineyards,\nDrunk with song and laughter,\nAnd bittersweet juice,\nRed with love and promise."}\n\nYou know a good vintage when you taste one, and also how to grow grapes and press them, to actually make wine.

paginae/skills/woodsmanship=$i{"In the depth of winter,\nLie hidden away,\nAlong secret trails,\nThe seeds of spring."}\n\nYou have walked the wilds for some time, and know your way around them. You have greater success when planting trees.
paginae/skills/wzm=$i{"Wicked portents,\nA black ash dripping with blood.\nAnd the entrails whisper\nOf lies and deceit."}\n\nYou have begun yearning for something... more. The Will to Power is the first step on the left-hand path of domination, and it is not without consequence.
