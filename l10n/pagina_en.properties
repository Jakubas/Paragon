paginae/craft/oddends=Various non-equipped tools and one-offs.\n
paginae/skills/rage=$i{"Insults fell on his mind,\nLike sparks on wet leaves,\nUntil the leaves, one day, were dry.}\n\nYou've had quite enough, and someone is going to get it hard and fast. Rage allows you to initiate combat with other Hearthlings.\n\nBeware that each breach of the Hearthlaw leaves a Crime Scent -- which can be used to track you down -- and that being an outlaw prevents your character from being logged out for some time after the offense.\n\n
paginae/skills/locks=$i{"This place was not for you,\nWas not meant for your eyes,\nWas locked away for me alone."}\n\nYou have learned how to craft and install locks to protect chests, coffers, and gates from intruders.\n
paginae/skills/winemaking=$i{"In autumn vineyards,\nDrunk with song and laughter,\nAnd bittersweet juice,\nRed with love and promise."}\n\nYou know a good vintage when you taste one, and also how to grow grapes and press them, to actually make wine. The secret? Ferment grape juice in demijohns, and store it in barrels.\n
paginae/skills/painting=$i{"Ettinaz saw the signs,\nAnd read the Omens right.\nHe made from hides a tapestry,\nTo tell the gruesome tale."}\n\nYou can wield a brush, and mix the pigments, to create graphic patterns of your own from images uploaded to the Haven & Hearth webpage.\n
paginae/skills/lumber=$i{"Birch, and Elm, and Yew, and Fir,\nNine and one,\nHe fell them all,\nAsh, and Beech, and Larch, and Pine.}\n\nYou have learned how to use an axe to fell and prepare trees. Remember that stumps can be dug out with shovels.\n
paginae/skills/yeomanry=$i{"Kolbjorn first broke the land around the Veitvast,\nHis family now sits in unbroken line by that water,\nTheir Halls ringing with mead and laughter."}\n\nYou have made enough of an impact upon the world to begin thinking of some certain parts of it as being your own. You may construct Claim Poles, and begin claiming private plots of land around them.\n
paginae/skills/beekeeping=$i{"Golden Honey flowing,\nFrom flowerbeds and trees,\nThe sweetest things of nature,\nAre brought to us by bees."}\n\nOne hears a familiar buzzing around your parts these days. You have learned how to construct and maintain beehives.\n
paginae/skills/firstaid=$i{"He saw as his task,\nTo pay every tribute of need.\nFor some water,\nFor others rest,\nUnder the shade of trees."}\n\nYou have figured out how to brew, prepare, and apply, some basic compresses, potions, and poultices, to heal wounds and illness.\n
paginae/skills/wzm=$i{"Wicked portents,\nA black ash dripping with blood.\nAnd the entrails whisper\nOf lies and deceit."}\n\nYou have begun yearning for something... more. The Will to Power is the first step on the left-hand path of domination, and it is not without consequence.\n
paginae/skills/sausagemaking=$i{"Crank of lever,\nPull of pork,\nSplit the bone,\nWield the fork."}\n\nYour mind has begun salivating at the prospect of turning red meat and casings into some of the most succulent, delightful, morsels imaginable.\n
paginae/skills/steelmaking=$i{"Born in flame,\nYet cold and silent,\nThirsting for blood.\nWho am I?"}\n\nThe embers of your forge have run glowing red hot, and from them now spring the strangest, most wonderful materials. You have learned how to make steel in steel crucibles, and also enjoy greater success at forging wrought iron.\n
paginae/skills/forage=$i{"Full in her pride she stood,\nBlossoming through spring and autumn,\nWild with fruit and harvest-flowers."}\n\nYou know a thing or two about the wild plants of the land, and can see and pick a lot of them if you find them. Increasing your "Perception" and "Exploration" values will help you find more Foregables, but Foregables can only ever be found when fate allows.\n
paginae/skills/crp=$i{"The three drew up along the Tostan,\nTo there do nail and build,\nA mighty Hall of Oak and Cedars."}\n\nYou have learned how to saw boards from logs, and more advanced constructions have also been made available to you, provided you know the right materials.
paginae/skills/metalworking=$i{"Embers glow in a furnace,\nA plow glows in the field,\nSwords glow in battle."}\n\nYou have learned how to smelt and forge the common metals, as well as how to build crucibles, anvils and smelters, provided you have found their requisite materials. You also discover slightly better ores when mining.\n
paginae/skills/plantlore=$i{"Growing silently,\nFrom shadows everflowing,\nLight of greenery."}\n\nYou have begun developing a certain mastery of plant both wild and tame. You gain more seeds when farming, and plant trees with greater success.\n\n\n
paginae/skills/tres=$i{"In the black of night,\nAlgaur found a hidden path,\nThrough the briar-patch,\nTo deep, and secret places."}\n\nYour feet have begun wandering to the strangest places, ending up where they really have no business of ending up. Trespassing allows you to manipulate claimed things without permission, for example to look in containers.\n\nBeware that each breach of the Hearthlaw leaves a Crime Scent -- which can be used to track you down.\n
paginae/skills/tunneling=$i{"Caroubdin, High King\nDemanded of his mountain realm,\nIn the third month of the Conflux,\nRed Gold, and Blue steel."}\n\nYou have begun getting to know the mountain, its ways and means, and its cruel, fickle whims. You may construct stone columns to support your mining operations, and you find better ores when mining.\n
paginae/skills/gardening=$i{"Green and cool,\nWarm and welcoming,\nYour garden plot,\nAnd home."}\n\nYou enjoy gardening, and consequently gain significantly more seeds when farming. The peace of mind which only a tranquil garden brings also garners you an improved success rate when unraveling silk cocoons.\n
paginae/skills/silk=$i{"Ratjik's shirt was sewn,\nNot from fibre, nor hide,\nNot from animal, nor plant,\nWhat stuff made Ratjik's shirt?"}\n\nYou've been spending time among the mulberries, and have learned how to farm and handle silk. Breed Silkmoths, set their eggs on herbalist tables, feed the worms mulberry leaves, and unravel the cocoons.\n
paginae/skills/theft=$i{"There lay hidden Woglin's gold,\nBanded rings and bands in mounds,\nNo one saw it leave,\nSave Vilgoth and the Moon."}\n\nYour long, spindly, fingers have begun developing a particular itch, now ripe for the scratching. Theft allows you to steal from claims and claim objects. \n\nBeware that each breach of the Hearthlaw leaves a Crime Scent -- which can be used to track you down -- and that being an outlaw prevents your character from being logged out for some time after the offense.\n
paginae/skills/hunting=$i{"In a bloodred moment,\nThe beast fell still,\nGiving life through death."}\n\nFor what it's worth you have built up enough skill and courage to dare to attack, slay, dress, and prepare wild animals. Beware that some fell beasts of the wilds will kill and eat you, and that you might not be a competent enough fighter yet to take them on. Start out small, with Ants, and build your skills, before going for bigger prey.\n\nSome small animals, like Rabbits and Frogs, can be picked up without a fight, if you can catch them.\n
paginae/skills/tanning=$i{"And it gleamed in the sun,\nTheir polished armor made,\nOf red and purple leathers."}\n\nYou have learned the odorous but rewarding trade of turning prepared animal hides into leather. Build a "Tanning Tub", fill it with "Tanning Fluid", and place your hides in it.\n
paginae/skills/mining=$i{"King Under The Mountain,\nCrowned in stone and steel,\nHis deep mine and torch-lit halls."}\n\nYou have a basic understanding of the common minerals, and of how to mine them, and can thus construct Mine Shafts and Supports provided you have found appropriate materials.\n
paginae/skills/mechanics=$i{"A dream of soot,\nAnd cogs in rhythmic motion,\nAnd sprawling, clockwork cities."}\n\nThrough ardent study of the primary forces you have learned how to construct more intricate tools with moving parts.\n
paginae/skills/druidicrite=$i{"By the first moon of the solstice,\nEsthan brought swine to the Irminsul,\nThere hanging them for eight days,\nResting dead on soot-black branches."}\n\nYou have walked the dark wilds, and seen the moon rise over shallow graves where the mandrake weeps. You enjoy the greatest possible yields when farming, planting trees, and unraveling silk cocoons.
paginae/skills/woodsmanship=$i{"In the depth of winter,\nLie hidden away,\nAlong secret trails,\nThe seeds of spring."}\n\nYou have walked the wilds for some time, and know your way around them. You have greater success when planting trees.\n
paginae/skills/boating=$i{"Glimma, mighty ship,\nBuilt from boards of Cherry,\nTo sail into the Sun."}\n\nYou have learned how to construct a rowboat to strike out along unknown lakes and rivers.\n
paginae/skills/stonework=$i{"Valind hew these stones,\nBearing in silent witness,\nA boast to his father."}\n\nYou have learned how to extract some measure of beauty and utility from the unfulfilled promises of wild rock and stone.\n
paginae/skills/farming=$i{"Watered by sweat there grew,\nGolden in Autumn, that Spring,\nWhere Winds did play and hide,\nIn sun-kissed Wheat and Barley."}\n\nYour hands lie heavy on plow and scythe, clawing in your palms the furrows of age and hard labor. You know how to till and plow, and how to plant seeds.\n
paginae/skills/metallurgy=$i{"Deep by the roots of the mountain,\nLocked away behind cold and stone,\nGleaming in the dark, \nClamoring to be found."}\n\nYou have acquired a natural mastery of the metals, their uses and abuses. You discover slightly better Ores, and enjoy significantly greater success when forging wrought iron.\n
paginae/skills/jewelry=$i{"Timeless luster,\nAge and tradition,\nBeauty eternal."}\n\nYou have learned how to work with the precious metals, and other fine materials, of the Hearthlands, to make jewelry.\n
paginae/skills/swim=$i{"Nine drops of rain-water,\nHe carried,\nOver land and black seas."}\n\nYou know how to get yourself out on deep water, which unfortunately carries with it the risk of never getting back alive to the shallows again. Death by drowning is a real risk for the unwary, and Hearthlings need a high "Constitution" value to swim for any considerable durations of time.\n
paginae/skills/archery=$i{"Where Alfthing fell,\nOn blood-wet grass,\nA broken arrow."}\n\nWith basic mastery of Archery you can draw and fire bows, fletch arrows, and sew quivers.\n
paginae/skills/fishing=$i{"The fathoms give nothing,\nYield not a single thing,\nBut to the fishermens' snares."}\n\nYou have mastered some basic fishing techniques, and can craft rods, poles, hooks, and lures.\n\nThere are two types of fishing: Rod and pole. Pole fishing uses various forms of live or fleshy bait -- such as earthworms, entrails, or ants -- whereas Rod fishing uses lures. Fishing poles catch fish immediatley whenever they bite, but the more demanding Rod fishing rather requries you to actually land the Fish by figuring out the many riddles of the sport. The truly rare fish of the world are caught with rods.\n
paginae/skills/wheelwrighting=$i{"Creaking along,\nIn mud-swollen tracks,\nBut steady,\nAnd sturdy,\nTurns the Wheel of Seasons."}\n\nYou have figured out how to fashion a wheel for use in a cart, a wheelbarrow, or the like.\n
paginae/skills/ahusb=$i{"Harnessed by the Old Gods,\nThe Urox plowed across the skies,\nThe furrow of time."}\n\nYou have had enough close encounters with various beasts of the Wild Hearth that the thought of taming some of them has entered your mind. You may snare and keep tamable beasts, as well as construct coops, troughs, and hitching posts.\n\nTo tame a wild, tamable, animal: \nFirst, lure it to you with clover.\nThen snare it with a rope.\nThen tie it to a hitching post.\nThen, when soon it stands ready to fight,\nDefeat it in combat again, and again,\nBut when it yields to you, yield to it,\nAnd hurt it no further,\nUntil its beast has been quelled.\n
paginae/skills/ropetwin=$i{"One over one,\nHe drew round over round,\nTwinning rope from golden strands"}\n\nYou can construct and use a Rope Walk to stretch, twine, and tie ropes.\n
paginae/skills/pottery=$i{"Cracked, the potter's clay,\nPouring water, scraping dry,\nThe Vessel of Eternity.}\n\nYou've learned the art of making pots, cups and vases from clay. You can dig for clay in the shallows, and fire your produce in a Kiln.\n
paginae/skills/sewing=$i{"She stayed up, night on night,\nUnder pale moons and distant stars,\nSewing her shirt for a son lost."}\n\nYou posses basic skills with needle and thread, allowing you to create several relevant products from cloth and fabric.\n
paginae/skills/artifice=$i{"The Great Clockwork of the Hearth,\nTells the time of all times,\nTicks the sun, moves the beast, draws forth the plants to eat."}\n\nYou have seen far beyond the mundane trivialities of petty craftsmanship, and your thoughts seek in all matters of artifice the eternal. You enjoy the greatest possible success when mining and forging wrought iron.\n
paginae/skills/hearthmagic=$i{"Hildur was a wise one,\nOld crone rich in years,\nThey said she knew the runes,\nRunes to make a broom dance,\nA cat bark,\nA sound of silence."}\n\nYou have discovered that certain events in the shadowlands between dream and waking may cause the rules of the Deep Magic to bend, just a little, and have learned how to create some simple artefacts of sympathetic import.\n
paginae/skills/baking=$i{"Rising slowly,\nLeavened with time,\nSweet as the ages."}\n\nSomething smells lovely, and you seem to know what. You've learned the basics of whipping up a good bread or pie.\n
paginae/skills/forestry=$i{"Elfafnr nursed by the springs of Tain,\nThree Oaks for each of the Norns,\nTwo Linden trees for the Old,\nApples for himself."}\n\nYou care for the land and are able to do so. Through ardent study of the natural primacies you have developed an aptitude for treeplanting, and enjoy significantly greater success at it. Studies of the mulberry tree in particular have also increased your success rate when unraveling silk cocoons.\n
paginae/quest/eatdrink=All this shifting about has made you hungry, and your stomach growls to remind you that you should probably acquire some food and drink before you starve. Whenever you perform laborious tasks your energy meter depletes to refill your stamina meter. You can refill your energy by eating, and you can speed up stamina regeneration from energy by drinking water. Eating food also gives you Food event points (FEPs), and whenever your FEP-meter is full, it empties out to earn you an increase to a base attribute! You should try this stuff out, and you think you might begin with...\n
paginae/quest/ccquest=Your spirit has awoken to find itself floating over a cold pool of water, reflecting a vast, ancient forest. Seek the Wizard, give him your name, and walk with the flames to be burned into the world.\n
paginae/quest/gearshift=As you explore your surroundings it occurs to you that certain essential modalities appear more fundamental to Hearthlife than others, and that those paramount few must be mastered for further insight to be possible. Somewhere in the yonder a small bird chirps, as you dreamingly begin laying plans to...\n
paginae/quest/wildways=The air is different, and the world seems to assume a more profound sense of reality with every passing moment, as the forest before time disappears like a dream half-remembered. The vast expanses of the Hearth stretch out before you in every direction, and you are free to roam as you please. Curiosity, however, implores you to...\n
paginae/act/survey=By Surveying the land you can create efficient landscaping projects for when you want to flatten, raise, lower or otherwise modify the terrain around you. A Survey allows you to set an intended terrain height for the area of the Survey, toward which you can then work by adding, removing -- or simply moving -- soil.\n
paginae/act/crime=Your character will refuse to commit crimes unless "Criminal Acts" are active. Every time you commit a crime you will leave a "Scent" behind, a clue to the nature of the crime commited, that can be used by others to track you down.\n\nBeware that all the four serious crimes -- theft, vandalism, battery and murder -- will also make you an "Outlaw" for some time, preventing your character from being logged out while the Outlaw status lasts.\n\nCommitting serious crimes can, thus, easily cause you to lose your character.\n
paginae/act/inspect=The Inspect tool tells you the qualities of an object.\n
paginae/act/tracking=All crimes committed -- trespassing, theft, vandalism, assault, battery and murder -- leave clues according to their types, and these clues -- "Scents" -- can be used to track down and locate the perpetrator of the crime in question, in order, presumably, to bring him to justice. The "Reek of Theft", the scent type left when stealing, also allows you, when applicable, to track the actual object or item that was stolen.\n\nScents are displayed on the map and minimap as stinking footprints, but only while "Tracking" is active.\n
paginae/wound/asphyxiation=You've held your head under the waterline for far longer than was good for you, and paid the price. You feel a little stupid still.\n\nThis wound will probably heal of itself.\n\nIntelligence: -5\n
paginae/wound/poulticetreat=You have treated a wound with Stinging Poultice, and have good hopes that it will now slowly heal.\n\nStrength:  -2\nAgility:   -3\n
paginae/wound/concussion=You remember that time you got knocked out cold? No, of course you don't, and therein lies the problem. You've faceplanted a few times too many, and are suffering as a result.\n\nThis wound will heal over time.
paginae/wound/nicksnknacks=It ain't much, but it's something. You've received one or several small wounds of various, indistinct, but minor, types.\n\nThis wound will probably heal of itself.
paginae/wound/fellslash=A wicked gash of red runs across your skin where the sharp edge plowed its cruel furrow.\n
paginae/wound/unfaced=Your face has taken a good beating, but for some reason it doesn't bother you that much,\n
paginae/wound/swollenbump=For some reason you have a large, sore, and swollen bump on you.\n
paginae/wound/scrapesncuts=Some of those Nicks & Knacks you had gone and gotten yourself have turned a lot nastier from further trauma.\n\nThis wound will slowly heal of itself.
paginae/wound/deepcut=You have managed to cut yourself, or someone has managed it for you. A deep, incisive rift in your hide now glares back at you.\n
paginae/wound/punchsore=In a million different places you didn't know you had, you're punch-sore from a good beating. You hope you gave as good as you got.\n\nThis wound will probably heal of itself.
paginae/wound/bruise=A blunt impact against your body has caused blooms of blueish purple to spring out where it hit you.\n\nThis wound will probably heal of itself.\n
paginae/wound/leechburns=Leeches have gnawed and nibbled at your juicy self, and you're left with a burning sense of fatigue and indistinct nausea.\n\nThis wound will probably heal of itself.
paginae/gov/vflag=A Village Banner increases the claimed area of your village.\n
paginae/gov/leave=Permanently renounce your membership in the Village and return instead to personal independence.\n\nLeaving a Village drains the Village of some Authority.\n
paginae/gov/revoke=Revoke a Personal Claim beneath your Village's Domain.\n\nYou may only revoke Claims established after your Village's Domain in an area.\n\nRevoking a Personal Claim drains a significant amount of Authority from your Village, determined by the size of the Claim revoked.\n
paginae/gov/invite=Induct new members into your Village by requesting their Oath of Allegiance.\n
paginae/gov/cstone=A Charter Stone allows for travel between it and any other Charter Stone. Assign a name to your Charter Stone, and anyone can travel to it, from any other Charter Stone, by simply entering that name. You can also travel to other Charter Stones you know the names of, from your own. A Village may have one Charter Stone.\n
paginae/gov/gov=Actions pertaining to the administration, maintenance, and rule, of and over the Village of which you are a member.\n
paginae/gov/cstatue=A Chieftain's Statue increases the Authority Cap of your village.\n
paginae/gov/fieldcairn=A Field Cairn can be used to designate a region of special privileges of use and abuse per group of village members, as a local exception to the general village rules.

paginae/exp/headwaters=The river winds, on and on, and up and away. Whether you have followed the river here, or whether you stumbled upon it, you have nevertheless discovered its source here at these Headwaters. From this spring the river is continously made anew.\n

paginae/exp/genderbread=It has been said that certain primordial, mystical, dualities of the Deep Magic will not come undone until at the End of Ages, when Hearthling is the wolf of Hearthling, and all hope is lost. Are you a man or a woman, spirit? The path ahead demands a choice.\n\nOn your left hand is the female path. On your right the male.\n\nChoose wisely.
paginae/exp/dawnbreak=They say that the night is always at its darkest just before dawn, and never was this more true than this morning, as the sun rises in unusual splendor over the horizons, burning away any lingering shadows of the night. This fast breaking dawn is truly spectacular.\n

paginae/exp/roaringfire=You are at the end of your efforts when, from crooked tinder set before you, there suddenly leaps, born of a single spark, a mighty Worm of flames blazing, wrapped in manes of soot and crimson.

paginae/exp/abyssalchasm=There is a draft, quite cool, from lower recesses, and it is only a faint echo from below which prevents you from suddenly tumbling headfirst down the scar on the world which now stretches out before you. You have found an Abyssal Chasm, and from it blow ill winds.\n
paginae/exp/spelunking=You've entered a cave, and the light from the outside now grows fainter as you delve deeper into it. The cave appears to stretch on for some distance into the pitch.

paginae/exp/fashionlove=You know that you at some point may have to part with this thing that you made, and that's fine, but for now, for this once, you stand in silent, humble, marvel at the simple perfection here sprung forth from your hands.\n
paginae/exp/settingvats=Is it just you, or are you always the one left doing this? It reeks to the High Havens, the stuff seems to seep into every pore of your being, and, frankly, its heavy, and if you had a gold pebble for every bucket you've dropped...

paginae/exp/dreamletgo=You open your hand just slightly, and suddenly it's gone in a puff of pink and sugar. Perhaps you threw it away. Perhaps you just dropped it. Perhaps you gave it to the world. Either way you let go of your beautiful dream, and it is now gone.\n
paginae/exp/quenching=You drink deep and greedily in full, dank, draughts, as visions of mist and Huldra dance within the theatre of your mind's eye.

paginae/exp/charexit = You burn in the fire for what seems like an eternity, in unbearable pain singing through every fibre of your body, convulsing in darkness and flame, and it is with relief that you then suddenly sense the quite different note of a cool breeze, somewhere high above and beyond the fire and the pain. The breeze grows softly stronger, soothing your charred skin, and cooling the rage around you. Before long, there is only the wind.\n
paginae/skills/oral = $i{"Of all the Ancients,\nMost among them saw Walwar,\nYet always spoke he the least."}\n\nThey say that the first stories were passed to the Hearthlings by the Old Gods. Some ancient things have always been known, and this is one of them.\n
