# Paragon

Paragon is a custom client for Haven & Hearth. It is based on Amber Client which is created by Romovs
(https://github.com/romovs/amber). The goal of this client is to automate repetitive game tasks. 
Automation/Botting and modification of the Game Client is allowed by the game devs so this client
is with compliance of the game's EULA. All the features that were added to Paragon can be seen 
in the CHANGELOG.
