## Version 1.0
### Added:
- Farming automation that automates harvesting fields of any size
- Patrol bot that walks around a path and plays a sound if an enemy is found, 
the user must provide the sound file in the build directory in sounds/alarm.wav
- A path generator for the patrol bot	
- A bunch of hooks and utilities used by the Patrol and Farming automation

### Changed: 
- Added a button to the main game interface that appears after logging in. Clicking on this 
button provides the user with a list of bots that they can run
- Modified files in the haven package so that I could access the data and classes that I need 
for my automations
